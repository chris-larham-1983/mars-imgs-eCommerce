### General Information

This is my solution to the **Codecademy** portfolio project entitled *Create an e-commerce application*, wherein I had to design 
a fully-functioning e-commerce application that allows users to perform various *CRUD* operations such as registering for 
an account, browsing products, adding products to cart, completing a purchase, checking order history etc. 

The application had to satisfy the following requirements:

- be built using the <strong>PERN</strong> stack (<strong>P</strong>ostgreSQL, <strong>E</strong>xpress, <strong>R</strong>eact, <strong>N</strong>ode.js)
- enable users to create a personal account
- enable users to browse products
- enable users to complete a purchase using a payment processor (Stripe)
- enable users to view order history
- use Git version control
- be developed locally 
- be published on Heroku

In addition, I added the ability for logged-in users to add items to their wishlist, and for them to update their delivery address.  A basic email 
is also sent to the customer on completion of a successful transaction.
